# Fonts

The site's four typefaces are self-hosted from this directory, so `next build` never
downloads fonts. Fetching them from Google Fonts at build time made the sister sites' builds
fail at random: `next/font/google` crashes (`loader.js`, "Cannot read properties of null
(reading '1')") when a font URL in Google's CSS has no file extension.

| File | Family | Coverage | Used for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `syne-latin.woff2` | Syne, weights 600–800 | Google Fonts latin subset | Display headings |
| `space-grotesk-latin.woff2` | Space Grotesk, weights 400–700 | Google Fonts latin subset | Interface text |
| `jetbrains-mono-latin.woff2` | JetBrains Mono, weights 400–700 | Google Fonts latin subset | Code and numbers |
| `noto-sans-sc/*.woff2`, `noto-sans-sc.css` | Noto Sans SC, weights 400–900 | Google Fonts' 101 unicode-range slices | Chinese pages only |

The files are the variable fonts as Google Fonts serves them, the same files AlgoAlgo and
DataData self-host. The three Latin families are loaded with `next/font/local` in
`app/layout.tsx`; Noto Sans SC is loaded through the plain `@font-face` rules in
`noto-sans-sc.css`, and only the font stacks under `html[data-lang="zh"]` in
`app/globals.css` name it, so English pages download none of its slices.

All four families are licensed under the SIL Open Font License 1.1, which permits
redistributing them with this site. Each file carries its copyright notice and license in its
metadata; the license is published at https://openfontlicense.org.
